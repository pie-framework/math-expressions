# math-expressions

> This is a fork of the original [math-expressions][orig]. It contains some api changes that allow us to override default behavior. We may pr at some point.

## DANGER ZONE

We only use a part of this repo, so we've been making breaking changes so long as our use of it is successful.

This lib has had parts removed and libs bumped, you most likely want to use the upstream repo.

### TODO

- alot of slow tests failing
